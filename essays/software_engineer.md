Although I use software applications or websites a lot, I am curious about how the production process is and who is running it, and I wanted to try it. The best way to learn how to design a program is to create a service instead of learning a language in depth. For the past two years, I have used what I learned in college, made some simple video games, or programs that I can use alone. But I have never produced anything that other users can use. I had some research about how I can make that software.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the main reasons for web page-making, and PHP is needed to open the server. Node.js, express.js, etc. I was able to find many keywords in developing JavaScript projects. There are many ways to create such a project, and I also want to experience operating services. I look forward to learning and trying exciting activities in this course.

I wish to learn how to organize and communicate within the group in a systematic way. I think the two have a close relationship with each other. To communicate with the team members, a clear explanation of what to be produced is needed systematically. If a complete framework is developed for the group in the early stages of the work, later work becomes very easy and efficient. If the program is made directly without designing, and the code turns up to be more than tens of thousands of lines, it will become an unmaintainable and dirty program. I do not want my programs not being used because it cannot be maintained except myself. After I finish this course, I hope that I will be the one who designed these programs and make programs that could be used for a long time.
