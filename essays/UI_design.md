The UI is the first thing to be seen to the users, despite it is an application, a web page, or a game. When we meet people, the first impression remains the longest in memory, and most of the perception is determined. UI is the first impression of the product. Therefore, it is critical to have a positive first impression, so the best way to make people approach my products is to decorate the UI nicely.

The first Html website I created was terrible. The website was consisting of header, image, and paragraphs. Also, I did not even know anything about CSS. It was only black text with white background. After learning CSS, I knew that I could put the contents in the desired place and make various adjustments with the elements such as font, background, and margin. However, it was far from theoretical enough to create a website that is nice looking. It is complicated to adjust the location one by one.

The UI design using Semantic UI was beautiful. Merely adding “container” made the space more spacious and no longer visible as a terrible website. Semantic UI was not challenging to use. Most of the functions can be done by simply writing down the corresponding class to the div, and the class names are also in simple English. Therefore, it was able to use without memorizing, and there is no difficulty in learning. However, knowing how to use and using well are different. I look forward to seeing myself improve in web page design through more experience. Afterward, I am looking forward to learning more from the class and create a nice website by combining JavaScript with a great UI.
