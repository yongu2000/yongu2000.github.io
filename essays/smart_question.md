While programming, there will be moments when you encounter various problems and need help. It is natural to have a problem while doing various works. For example, a question about the syntax of a language, the algorithm you are trying to implement, and the memory allocation. When we face an unknown problem, we look for relevant information or ask someone else for help. The best way to ask for help is to ask questions. There must be plenty of people who had the same problem as me, and there must be plenty of people who know the answer as well.
 
## Who/Where can I ask?
Since I am currently a student, there is a way to ask professors or TA. I can also ask students who take the same class. However, it is difficult to visit and ask in person in online classes such as today due to COVID-19. So, we can use an online format is the website called "Stack overflow." This website is the largest developer community, where numerous questions and answers are posted.
 
## How should I ask the question?
Asking a question is to get help from others. Because the respondent does not know what I do not know and does not know what I want to know. We must explain the question as detailed and easy to understand. Also, I should have a polite and thankful attitude as a requesting position. If I do not ask the question appropriately, it is hard to expect the answer that I want. Also, I should always be polite since no one will answer me if I am rude. Therefore, you need to know how to ask questions in a “smart way”.
 
## Non-smart question
[This is a non-smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12600363/cant-compile-this-code) that I found in Stack overflow. This question asked about the compilation process, he wanted to know what went wrong in his code. He uploaded his code and error message along with the question. In my opinion, this question is a non-smart question because we do not know where the problem at which part of the code is. There is no explanation for what this program does, and the question is too broad. It is difficult for the respondent to see all the codes to find the problem. Also, he attached his code into a link other than in the text, making the respondent not want to see the code and answer it.
 
## Smart question
[This is a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171251/how-can-i-merge-properties-of-two-javascript-objects-dynamically) that I thought was smart on the contrary. This question asked if he/she was merging the two objects of JavaScript and presented the exact goal along with the example code in the content. This is what I think of as a way to ask a smart question because it is a simple question to answer if there is related knowledge. The question is clear about what he wanted to know. However, the content was a simple question that can be found just by searching on Google. Although the question itself was not so smart, the method of asking the question is what I think is a smart way of asking a question. 
 
## Conclusion
To get answers by asking questions, someone has to answer them. That is why we have to ask the best questions and ask efficient questions to get answers. Even in Stack overflow, smart questions had more recommendations and replied answers, and those non-smart questions had fewer or no answers. Therefore, if I ask questions on Stack overflow later when I need help, I should ask smart questions according to Eric Raymond's guidelines and get the answer I want.
