There was not much difficulty in learning JavaScript at first. It was able to adapt quickly because there were similarities and overlapping concepts from my background of learned programming languages. The syntax of the overall language is similar to C or Java, but slightly different. For example, there is no type declaration in JavaScript! It was surprising that the size of the array is not specified, and it can be allocated flexibly. Also, there is no syntax error when the elements of the array are different for every index. It seemed convenient, but I felt if I do not concentrate while I code, I might get confused later. Javascript is also an object-oriented language and is supported by a variety of operating systems and web browsers. So, I think it is a language suitable for software engineering.

 The main thing I studied this week was the syntax and the basics of JavaScript. I have solved the problems in FreeCodeCamp once. However, since this is my first-time learning JavaScript, there must be certain parts of it that I will forget. I am still at a beginner level, and there is still a long way to go. I will look for what I do not know, then slowly increase on JavaScript knowledge. In the end, I will be confident to say, "I can code with JavaScript."

 The amount of learning and practice needed for WOD did not cause lots of stress until now. Maybe it will be stressful if there are plenty of things to study or the practice problem is difficult. However, to improve the skill of coding and Javascript, it is necessary to stay close to code and practice frequently. From this point of view, WOD will certainly help to improve my skill. If I get a habit of “WODing” early now, I will solve at least one practice question every day even after finishing this course. It is best if I do not feel stressed when I study,  but I believe a little bit of stress can improve my ability.
