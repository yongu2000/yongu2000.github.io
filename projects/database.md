This project was done in the ICS program structure class in the first semester of the second grade. I created a program that stores information about account numbers, names, and addresses. The program is controlled by a UI and database. There were functions add, find, delete, printall, quit. Add prompts the user to enter the information above. Find function finds the information corresponding to the account number. Delete function deletes the information corresponding to the account number. Printall prints out all the information in the database. Lastly, quit terminates the program.
 
What I learned while working on this project is the initial design of the program is important. When doing assignments, all I had to do is implement pre-designed functions in the order assigned to each week. However, when I do actual programming, I would have to set up the processes myself and make them on time. In that sense, this project became a good example for me as a guideline for future projects to be carried out. I learned what procedures I have to go through to create a program that fits the requirements of the client.
